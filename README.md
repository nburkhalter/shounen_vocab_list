# shounen_vocab_list
When it comes to learning Japanese, it doesn't get more fun than watching anime. This project creates a vocabulary list 
of the most common words and phrases from the top 50 unique shounen anime titles (per MyAnimeList) so that the viewer can 
jump right in to the adventure!

Nothing technical here. This is my first original data science project outside of online certifications, so I wanted a place to share my progress. The inspiration came from my history of learning Japanese. I'm not much of a textbook learner, so when I set off on this incredibly rewarding adventure, I made one rule for myself: If it's not fun, stop doing it.

So whether it was watching a show, reading manga, or practicing kanji strokes, if I got bored, I stopped and moved on to 
something else. I noticed that I would get the most bored/frustrated when reading a manga or watching an anime where I had to 
pause far too frequently to look up a word or phrase. It really interrupted the flow of the story, and I found myself back-
tracking in order to pick up where I left off.

This little project is intended for those that want to learn Japanese through anime. A little "cheat sheet" of sorts to help
get students through most of the dialogues found in anime.

Hope you find this helpful!
